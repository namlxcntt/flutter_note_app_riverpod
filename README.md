## About
Hi i'm Nam
During my Flutter learning journey (I am an Android Developer), I've realized that hands-on experience is more effective for me than purely theoretical courses.
I thought that people, like myself, are looking for a simple repository to learn and delve deeper into Dart and Flutter by actually working on something. That's why I created this repository. With just basic CRUD functions using a local database, I believe it can be more helpful to many individuals.
